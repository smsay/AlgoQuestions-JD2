        202. Happy Number
        Write a function that returns true if a number is a happy number, and false if it is an unhappy number.

        A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
            Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
            Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
            Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

        Example 1:
        Input: n = 19
        Output: True
        Explanation:
            19 is Happy Number,
            1^2 + 9^2 = 82
            8^2 + 2^2 = 68
            6^2 + 8^2 = 100
            1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
            As we reached to 1, 19 is a Happy Number.

        Example 2:
        Input: n = 20   Output: False

        Constraints:
        1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

    A number will not be a Happy Number when it makes a loop in its sequence which already been touched.

TC explanation:   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58977656/how-to-understand-time-complexity-of-happy-number-problem-solution-from-leetcode
space complexity: for simplicity of let's assume our input can only take the form (10, 100, 1000, ..., 10^d) where d+1 is the number of digits.
n = 10^d
take log of both sides
log(n) = d
number of digits = log(n) + 1
We usually ignore constants when we talk about big O and therefore the answer is O(log(n))
