Create an abstract class that has a constructor which prints

a non-abstract method which prints "This is a normal method of abstract class".
A class 'SubClass' inherits the abstract Class and has a method named ‘a_method' which prints "This is abstract method”.
Now create an Object of 'SubCIass' and call these methods (Analyze the result)
